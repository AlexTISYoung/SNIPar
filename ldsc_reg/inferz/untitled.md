$$
l_i = -\frac{d}{2} log(2 \pi) - \frac{1}{2} log |I + r_i S_i^{-1/2} V S_i^{-1/2} | - \frac{1}{2} z_i^T (I + r_i S_i^{-1/2} V S_i^{-1/2}) ^ {-1}z_i
$$

Its derivative with respect to V is given by:

$$
\frac{dl_i}{V} =-\frac{1}{2}[(I + r_i S_i^{-1/2} V _i^{-1/2}) r_i S_i^{-1/2}S_i^{-1/2} + z_i z_i^T [-(I + r_i S_i^{-1/2} V S_i^{-1/2} ) r_i S_i^{-1/2} S_i^{-1/2} (I + r_i S_i^{-1/2} V S_i^{-1/2})]]
